Welcome to the RGStarter GitHub! Here you will find all of the packages for the Package Installer and the Linux Installer within RGStarter, brought to you by Project Revive Software's. 

RGStarter is a free to use, one of a kind program for modified Xbox 360 consoles. It's purpose is to allow users to take control of their console, and have anything they may need for their modified consoles very easy to 
find. I decided to make RGStarter free for everyone to use due to the sheer lack of avaliable tools out there in the Xbox 360 modding community and with all the tools that are out there, they are either pay-to-use or 
extremely feature-lacking or outdated. RGStarter solves all of that not only by providing a free yet premium experience at no cost whatsoever, but with many new and unseen features that other tools simply do not have 
included.

If you have any questions, please feel free to join the discord and let me know. If you have any experience with errors or issues while using RGStarter, you may open an issue ticket or get ahold of our support staff in
